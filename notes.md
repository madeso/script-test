## lua + Selene
Nothing to build and easy to bind, but doesn't support LuaJIT.

## Javascript + v8
custom build tool, you just can't git the source and make, several custom steps
various api changes
 
 ## lua + luabind
 download from sourceforge, low activity(last update june 2013)
 seems to be focused on extending lua as a dll, not embedding, requires boost
